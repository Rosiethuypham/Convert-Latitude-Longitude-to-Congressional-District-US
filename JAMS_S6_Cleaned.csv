I just figured that since all of the earphones are roughly similar I would rather choose the ones with the nice colors. I didn't really consider anything else since all the earphones looked the same. I like these earphones additionally because they would match my phone case. I also like that the earphones are wireless since my phone doesn't have an earphone jack.

After that, I simply chose the option that had the colors I liked most, which were red and black.",6.88,218.644,219.807,6,7,7,6,7,5,7,5,5,7,7,5,1,5,5,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,4,4,4,2,1,1,1,4,5,4,3,1,5,6,6,5,5,6,1,3,3,2,3,3,3,4,318.50,2.33,10,8,1,,6,,2,1,1,1.00,,4,"JAMS5876764RFrmRFvS88929
